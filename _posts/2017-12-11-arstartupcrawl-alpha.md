title: AR Startup Crawl App in Private Alpha
---

After the startup crawl in 2017, I had a few ideas on how to improve the guest experience. I decided to make an app with the locations of startups, which beer is served where, descriptions of the companies, and a live update section so Startup Junkie can keep patrons up to date during the event. It's just a side project, but it will be ready for 2018 and help bring Fayetteville further into the tech scene.

The app is powered Google Cloud Platform and Firebase for usage analytics, crash reporting, data storage, and push notifications. All data and styles in the app can be configured in real time post-deployment with Firebase Realtime Database, making it easy to do testing and quickly make changes based on what customers want.
