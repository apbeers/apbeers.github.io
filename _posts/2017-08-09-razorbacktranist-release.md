title: Razorback Transit App Now Live
---

After listening to students about what they wanted out of Razorback Transit (our campus bus service), I built the razorback transit! The app intelligently caches all of the images for busses and stops to reduce network usage, decrease startup time, and stabilize performance in areas with low/spotty connectivity. Because of all of the caching, the bus locations can be updated every 5 seconds with minimal network usage (just a single JSON request). It is now live for both iPhone and Android with over 200 downloads between the two platforms.
