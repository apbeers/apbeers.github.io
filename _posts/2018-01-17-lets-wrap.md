Building an app that works across all iOS devices

I recently updated the first app I built to, Let's Wrap, to support iPhone X. It lets you calculate what size to cut wrapping paper for a present. I built this app in early 2016 because I wanted to work at Metova doing iOS development. I thought what better way to prove I can be an app developer than to publish an app! The biggest challenge with this app was supporting every device size. The iPhone X notch broke everything of course, I had to set custom constraints to handle the iPad vs iPhone, and extra code to handle how the app responds to the keyboard on iPad Pro 12.9 inch.

Oh, it also had a spike in US downloads on December 24th. Way to go guys.
