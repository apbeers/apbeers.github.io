title: 1st place team at hackathon

My team, team TIMELINE, won first place at the ConocoPhillips Innovation challenge in 2016. We built a web application for employees, manager, and executives to track progress, assign projects, and manage budgets that was fully hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). My specialization was setting up the Amazon Web Services hosting and security because I have a background with both networking and virtualization. I will upload pictures once ConocoPhillips shares the flickr album.
