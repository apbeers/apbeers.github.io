title: Arkansec 16 First Place Team
---

This Saturday, 10/21/16, a few of our U of A ACM members went to the ArkanSec16 hackathon to test our skills. We attended a 3-hour intro session about Kali Linux and various penetration testing tools. The competition was hosted using the open source Facebook CTF framework with custom questions and hacking challenges. Our team will be going back next year to see if we can keep it up!
