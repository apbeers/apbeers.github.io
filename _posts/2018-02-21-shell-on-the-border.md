title: Shell On The Border
---

A couple of weekends ago, I got to compete at the Shell on the Border cybersecurity event hosted by fs2600. Our team placed 7th out of 21 teams by solving a wide variety of questions. It was a great learning experience and really highlighted that there is room for every skill type in security, whether it's cracking shells, social engineerings, or writing code to solve problems quickly.
